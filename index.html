      Whats linux ?
    </h4>
    <p>
       Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.

    <h4>Why use Linux?</h4>
    <p>This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a completely different computing environment, when the operating system that ships with most desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine?

    To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that operating system you’re currently using really work “just fine”? Or, do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?
    If you struggle with the above, Linux might be the perfect platform for you. Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for a desktop platform.</p>

    <h4>What is a “distribution?”</h4>
    <p>Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).</p>
    <label>Popular Linux distributions include:</label>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">UBUNTU</a></li>
      <li><a href="">DEBIAN</a></li>
      <li><a href="">FEDORA</a></li>
      <li><a href="">KALI</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>Linux systems are rarely infected by malware such as viruses, worms etc, thereby making it as a very secure OS. As a normal user, we will never come across a situation where Antivirus software is been sold for Linux. This means, Linux is inherently secure and there are many reasons associated with it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>Open source</h4>
    <p>Linux is known for its superior performance and speed compared to Windows. It has a lightweight architecture that allows it to run smoothly on older hardware, which makes it a great choice for businesses or individuals who want to extend the life of their computers.</p>
